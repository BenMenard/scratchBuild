    <h4 class="question-header">When is a D-Ostomy most useful?</h4>
  </header>

  <p class="question">
    The D-Ostomy is most helpful when there is anatomy (bellybutton, incision,
    scar, rolls, folds, second ostomy, drains, etc) that make it hard for a
    normal appliance to land without overlap. The straight edge side of the
    D-ostomy can be placed next to these challenging areas, allowing the
    appliance to seal without involving the anatomy that may have caused issues
    in the past.
